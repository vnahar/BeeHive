# BeeHive

This is a simple script that demonstrates a basic workflow using Python to manage and parse calendar files in ICS format.

## Files and Their Purposes

- **config.py:** Contains configuration settings.
- **free_time_finder.py:** Script that finds free time based on the given schedule.
- **ics_parser.py:** Parses ICS files to extract calendar events.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the Python dependencies.
- **ics_files/**: Contains sample ICS files, such as birthdays and other events.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## Workflow

1. Configuration is set up in `config.py`.
2. ICS files in the `ics_files/` directory are parsed using `ics_parser.py`.
3. Free time is determined by running `free_time_finder.py`.
4. Dependencies are managed through `requirements.txt`.

## Additional Libraries

- **Google OR Tools:** A collection of optimization tools that can be used to solve scheduling, routing, and other complex combinatorial problems. This library offers powerful algorithms to handle constraint satisfaction and optimization tasks.
- **Other Libraries:** As the project evolves, additional libraries may be integrated to further enhance functionality and solve specific problems.

This repository is a basic setup and can be extended as needed.
